# legal-terms-kaios

A very silly example of a KaiOS app using [KaiUI](https://github.com/nadim1992/KaiUI)

> Run this app by using a server like WAMP, LAMP or MAMP

OR

>If you have PHP installed, just create a simple server
>Run the following on a terminal in this project root directory
```
php -S localhost:8989
```
and open http://localhost:8989 in a browser and use with keyboard

OR

> If you have KaiOS simulator installed then open as a packaged app

Thanks!
